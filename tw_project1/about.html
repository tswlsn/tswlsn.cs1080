	<h2><b>About</b></h2>
	<br>
	<p>I'm Thomas. I started making digital art back in 2021, and have made a couple good pieces over the years. Sometimes I still do!</p>
	<p>Attempts were made at traditional utensil-on-medium art, but despite all the classes it just never <i>clicked</i>. All the references and warmups and general practice in the work were not enough to overcome the massive setback that is aphantasia. How do you draw something when you can't even imagine it? It's certainly possible, but not with my patience. Now, digital art? Well, it was perfect being able to work with materials you can see and manipulate. I still can't envision what I want the end product to be, but it's a lot easier to tweak things to my liking when the process is non-destructive. As time went on, I learned more steps of the process, and now I do everything: Models, textures, rigging, lighting, composition, and even a dash of programming.</p>
	<p>Originally, I set out to make art purely for the sake of getting better at it. It was an abstract goal for the future, which I needed at the time. Of course, a few years ago, I realized that I was still just doing to get better at it. I had an exhibit at SVAC once, and a few commissions, but otherwise had minimal success and nothing came of it. But at that point, I realized I didn't want to do it for recognition, and I <i>certainly</i> didn't want to do it for money. Working for $2.00/hour for clients who hated your guts despite you doing all the work? It is not pleasant. I haven't done much art lately. Nothing has really taken its place, so I continue to flit between unfinished projects. Perhaps I'll even finish those one day!</p>
	<p>If I had any advice for aspiring artists, it would be this:
	<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center"><div></div><ul>
	<li>Don't make art for anyone except yourself.</li>
	<li>Don't monetize your art. Never sell it.</li>
	<li>Don't force yourself to make art. It doesn't work.</li>
	</ul><div></div></div>
	<br>
	<p>Anyways, the <a href="./gallery.html">gallery</a> contains the works I'm most happy with. It's funny how despite doing this for upwards of 3,000 hours, there's only a handful of pieces to show for it. The average "good" piece takes 30-40 hours, but I've spent plenty of time on projects that ended up unsalvageable, models left unused, and stuff that are just glorified tech demos for a specific technique or tool.</p>
